UMass Amherst summer semester 2020.

Course Description: This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the language of relational databases: Structured Query Language (SQL). Topics covered include: Entity-Relationship modeling, the Relational Model, the SQL language: data retrieval statements, data manipulation and data definition statements. All interactive reading problems involve the use of "live" SQL. Homework will be done using databases running in MySQL which students install on their machines. Students develop a real-world database project using MySQL during the course. 

Prerequisites: This course is designed for students who desire an intermediate level of proficiency with the Structured Query Language (SQL). Prerequisite: Basic computer literacy including ability to create and manipulate files and install software.

 

Justification: This course will provide a solid preparation in SQL for students in the Computer Science and Informatics majors who plan to take database or data science courses. A knowledge of this material is also an important skill for anyone planning to do software engineering and development. It is also a service course for students outside of the CS major who work with or plan to work with relational databases and data science such as students studying social science, business, biological and physical sciences, among others.

 

Course Objectives: 
Learn structured query language (SQL) to an intermediate/advanced level.
Be able to write data retrieval queries and evaluate the result set.
Be able to write SQL statements that edit existing data.
Be able to write SQL statements that create database objects.
